# The Workspace learning track
## Goal of the Workspace learning track
This page describes the initial setup of the Professional Workspace learning track. The intention is to provide a clear setup of education tracks that can be used by professionals to increase their knowledge and start working in a Workspace Environment or do projects at the customer or direct via Sogeti for the customer through the Sogeti Smart Workspace (SSW) service line. The goal is to get certified, master modern tech skills, and level up your career with cloud training — whether you’re starting out or a seasoned pro. Within this trajectory you can obtain the following courses for certificates which are important to work as a skilled Workspace Associate, within just 6 months:

* [**Microsoft 365 Certified: Fundamentals**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals/)
* [**Microsoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/modern-desktop/)
* [**Microsoft Certified: Azure Virtual Desktop Specialty**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-virtual-desktop-specialty/)
* [**Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/)

When being part of the SSW service line it is expected that you obtain specific knowledge about product used in the SSW proposition, which are:

* Hello ID Provisioning training
* Hello ID Service Automation training
* Liquit training
* Nexthink self-learning

By the end of the track, you will have finished three blocks, two months each, studying and getting a clear understanding of the basics and fundamentals of the Workspace arena, also you probably be able to tell which direction within the Workspace area you want to accelerate in. In addition to the three mandatory certifications, you will become familiar with other aspects of Workspace, gain a minimum of two new technical skills and two new service skills that you can add to your resume, portfolio, and overall career.

After achieving the Workspace Associate status, you can start to grow into the role as Workspace engineer, for which you will receive an additional 18 months of guidance through your coach and Career Manager. The additional 18 months will be called Block 4.

One mandatory certificate you must obtain in Block 4 will be:

* [**Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/m365-enterprise-administrator/)
