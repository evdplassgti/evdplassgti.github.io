# Introduction Device Management

Device Management takes care of centralized, cloud-based management of corporate client devices. Management of corporate policies and restrictions for employee owned devices connecting to the Smart Workspace, is the second objective for the Device Management module.

In the module, devices are managed using [**Microsoft Endpoint Manager**](./endpoint-manager/index.md), which is part of the 'Enterprise Management & Security' (EM+S) subscription and also is included in Microsoft 365 F3, E3 and E5 subscriptions. Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune) is the main component in Device Management.

The following activities are carried out:

* Onboarding (enrolling) devices into management
* Configuration and deployment of (security) policies and configurations
* Update management
* Application deployment

Within the service, the main scope is Windows laptops and (shared) desktops. Additionally, both company and personal owned mobile devices (Android and iOS smartphones and tablets) can be included.

Off course we want to give our customers and their users the best experience we can offer. To make sure user experience is at (or above) expected level and to monitor experience over time, we use the module [**User Experience Monitoring**](./user-experience-monitoring/index.md). This module provides us with insights on experience and health, enabling improvements and remediation. This module is included by default in Device Management.

On top of the base service, additional modules can be added upon request by the customer:

* [**Endpoint Privilege Access Management**](./endpoint-privilege-management/index.md). This module removes the need for local administrators, offering users additional permissions through a secure, centrally managed solution instead.
* [**Cloud Printer Management**](./cloud-printer-management/index.md). This module removes the need for print servers (on-premise or in the cloud), replacing them with a cloud hosted solution. Corporate printers are managed in a central web based console, for both administrators and end users.
