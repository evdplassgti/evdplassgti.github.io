# Introduction Workspace learning track
The Workspace learning track consists of a multitude of specializations. The primary reason for this is the amount of existing knowledge within professionals. We can utilize this knowledge and guide them towards their Workspace end-goal in a more precise manner. Additionally, the track is composed of several blocks. After individuals have chosen to participate, they can follow this manual to start at their own pace. After they have received their “basic knowledge” (building block 1), they will continue the track with building block 2 and 3 in combination with on-the-job experiences.

Each building block takes you to a higher level. The first building block contains information about the basics of the Workspace principals. Where you obtain the first 2 certificates and expect to obtain broad knowledge of Workspace and IT. Each building block is divided into a time frame of 2 months. After the initial 2 months you are expected to work on a Workspace related job. Or at least we do our best to get you into a Workspace-related job, where you can put your Workspace knowledge into practice and get hands-on with Workspace material. You continue to the second block of the fast track. Here you will gain more in-depth knowledge about products part of the Workspace proposition and other IT aspects relevant to Cloud technologies. Moving to block 3 you will learn about different IT Services methodologies. These are crucial as they are part of your daily activities as an engineer and future development.

## Workspace learning track overview
The total number of months is devised into the three building blocks, which comes to 6 months, which marks the total length of the Workspace learning track. 

Besides the certifications included in this track, one can do extra, or specialty certifications. In general, it is advised to first obtain one or more Associate level certificates before diving into a specialty certification. The specialty certifications need a certain basic understanding of Workspace and Associate Level certifications provide just that basic understanding. Best-practice is to start the professional level certificates after 2-3 years’ experience with the Workspace area. 

* To fit these certifications into the Fast Track for Professionals a 4th building block has been created, where you as a professional, together with your career manager, decide where you want to go from here on.

**Figure 1** schematically depicts how the learning track is divided in a chronological order. Based on this model the track has been further structured. Starting at the kick-off point and ending the track after 6 months. As seen on figure 1 the first part of the track is divided into 3 different building blocks (marked in blue).

* Block I: Workspace Foundation
* Block II: Technical Foundation
* Block III: IT Services

The first 3 blocks each have a time frame of 2 months. So, it’s the idea that one carries out the study material/activities in the green and blue marked blocks in the span of 2 months. All together the total number of months comes to 6, which marks the total length of the Workspace learning Track.

Further this document each block contains its own chapter with a detailed explanation and planning for what needs to be done for that specific track activity.
**Figure 1** is further elaborated in the form of tables in the “global planning” Chapter. One table equals one building block. So, **block I = table 1**. 

**Figure 2** shows the additional skills and training you must follow to be able to be part of the SSW service line and fully understand the Sogeti Smart Workspace proposition.

## Workspace learning track follow-up

**Figure 3** shows the final block, Block IV: Acceleration plan, when a student finalizes the first three blocks of the track within 6 months it shows already big potential. After those six months a student already has a Workspace related assignment at the customer or within the SSW service line and will gain a lot of experiences by doing work which expands the knowledge and able to convert theory to practice. Block IV will give the last guidance a student can help to successfully finish the Workspace learning track and being a Workspace engineer with a broad knowledge of all products which are important in the Workspace area.
