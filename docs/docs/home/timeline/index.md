# Timeline

The Track is devised into a total of 4 building blocks, each block contains the correct study material over a period of 2 months divided into chapters and subchapters.

|The table explain exactly what you are going to do and learn, where (i.e. which platform do you use), the material used to achieve the desired results, the learning paths/courses within PluralSight that must be followed with reference link for quick access. And finally, the results are written per sub-chapter (i.e. what result is expected from following a specific section within the block).|

The green outlined area in the tables represents the areas within the track that result in a certification as shown in figure 1. Each sub-chapter contains the section where to follow courses and study material that will prepare you for your Workspace related certification. Following the given PluralSight learning path and courses will prepare you for exactly the right section.

## Building Block I: Workspace Foundation

This block contains the first 2 months of content. Starting from chapter 2.1 you will first get a kick-off; this will be held in the first week. During the kick-off you will get a high-level overview of the Workspace and the track by a Workspace veteran. During this week you will be assigned a personal coach to guide you through the Workspace Fast Track, in addition you will also be getting a Visual Studio subscription to start and create your Office 365 lab environment. After that you will follow 2 months of training and learning while obtaining the First 2 Workspace related certificates according to schedule.

## Building Block II: Technical Foundation

In block II an extra column has been added, this column shows the technical modules as part of the technical expertise period. Within this period (2 months) you choose at least two modules in which you want to improve or learn a new skill. You do this in consultation with your coach. It is recommended that the chosen skill sets fit your needs and own motivation to learn them, to grow in your career. When completing one/or more of these courses you have “mastered” a new skill set, which you can add to your CV, Portfolio, and overall career. Optionally, you can certify yourself for most of the technical modules, but this is not mandatory when following the track.

As seen in Figure 1 and in Table 2, getting the ‘Microsoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate’ certificates span the timeframe of building Block II and Block III. The reason for this is that after the first 2 months you are expected to be working on an assignment. So, in addition to acquiring additional technical skills in Months 3 and 4, you will also be learning and earning either the Windows 10 (MD-100 or Managing Microsoft Desktops (MD-101). Given the time it's hard to get them both. You will have to make a choice in which of these certificates you want to do first (maybe in consultation with your coach). However, in addition to the chosen skills, at least one of these certificates is mandatory. So somewhere along the line of the last 4 months you have obtained your third Microsoft Certificate.

In addition to the standard Workspace program and Microsoft certificates, if you ae part of the SSW service line you need to follow the administration HelloID training days for Provisioning and Service Automation. Both take up in total two days initially, however if you already have PowerShell knowledge you can consider (maybe in consultation with your coach) to follow the second training day as well.

## Building Block III: IT Service Skills
In the past 2 blocks (last 4 months) you have been busy technically deepening Microsoft and other IT technologies. In this building block you will learn and study about IT service skills. These form a large part of our daily life as IT professionals in our field. Whatever assignment we get, where we work and what we do, all of us experience and unconsciously use these skills.

That's why we've filtered out the most important IT service skills you can have as an Workspace engineer. The idea is the same as in block II. You will have to choose which IT service skills you want to acquire and then study for that particular section. (again, in consultation with your coach). As explained above, you are probably also in the process of obtaining one of the two certificates you chose at the beginning of building block 2. Obtaining two of these IT service skills can result in certificates (optionally), moreover it will add great personal value.
