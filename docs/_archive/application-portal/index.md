# Applications: portal and packaging

The Sogeti Smart Workspace Application Portal service involves a central, web hosted location in which users can launch any application that is assigned to their user account. The Application Portal is a fully managed platform, installed, configured and maintained by Sogeti. Upon users wish, ordered by an application change request, applications can be added, removed or modified in the Application Portal. The portal integrates business applications in the workspace so end-users can launch all applications from a single pane of glass.

The Sogeti Smart packaging solution has a long history, from the introduction of Windows Installer (msi) in the year 2000 and is included in the service today. Applications are packaged through a defined process, producing different package types to deploy applications for end-users in client desktop and remote workspace environments.
