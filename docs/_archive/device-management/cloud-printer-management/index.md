# Cloud Printer Management

The Sogeti Smart Workspace Cloud Printer Management service is a centrally managed solution for management of your company printers. The service removes the need to have print servers installed in your network, thus lowering management, maintenance, and operational efforts.
After initial setup and configuration, users print to the printers in the network from their Windows devices, using the printer agent that is part of the service. With the current hardware specifications in mind, spooling of print jobs will occur locally on the client, saving hardware costs for print servers.
Optionally, the service provides options for a self-service portal and mobile printing for smartphones and tablets.
