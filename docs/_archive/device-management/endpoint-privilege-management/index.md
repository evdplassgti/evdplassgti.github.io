# Endpoint Privilege Access Management

The Sogeti Smart Workspace 'Endpoint Privilege Access Management' service for Windows
involves a centrally managed solution for privilege access management (PAM) on endpoint 
devices. After initial setup and configuration, users can be granted additional privileges on 
their device. These permissions are granted when they need to perform administrative tasks 
which otherwise requires elevation with a (local) administrator account. The type and 
duration of the privilege is configured using scope and profiles (who, what and how). 
Examples of use cases are standard users, who need the ability to install applications or 
technical workers, who need additional privileges to perform their tasks. As a result of this 
service, there is no longer a need for business users to have the local administrator account
on their device while workspace service managers have control and insight in administrative 
activities on managed endpoints.
